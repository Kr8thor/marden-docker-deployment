# Railway Deployment Summary

## Current Status

After multiple approaches and a new project creation, we're still encountering consistent 404 errors with the `X-Railway-Fallback: true` header. This indicates a likely issue with the Railway account or project configuration rather than with our code.

## Working Components

1. **API Service**: Deployed at https://api-service-production-51ad.up.railway.app
   - Simple Express server exposing health and audit endpoints
   - Includes properly configured railway.json
   - Still returning 404 with X-Railway-Fallback: true

2. **Web Service**: Deployed at https://web-service-production-6808.up.railway.app
   - Simple static HTML with Express server
   - Properly connects to the API service
   - Still returning 404 with X-Railway-Fallback: true

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Railway Support**:
   - Describe the persistent X-Railway-Fallback: true issue
   - Share details about multiple deployment attempts across different projects
   - Ask about account-level settings that might be preventing public access

2. **Check Railway Dashboard Settings**:
   - Verify project visibility settings
   - Check for any network restrictions
   - Ensure services are properly started and running

3. **Try Alternative Deployment Options**:
   - Prepare for deployment to alternatives like:
     - Render.com (similar serverless approach)
     - DigitalOcean App Platform (Docker support)
     - Heroku (good for Node.js applications)

## Custom Domain Configuration

Once deployment is successful:

1. Use the Railway CLI to add the custom domain:
   ```bash
   railway domain audit.mardenseo.com
   ```

2. Configure DNS Settings:
   - Add a CNAME record for `audit` pointing to your Railway domain
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 72 hours)

## Files Ready for Deployment

We've created multiple deployment-ready configurations:

1. `/api-service`: Simple API with Express
2. `/web-service`: Simple web frontend with Express server
3. `/railway-monorepo`: Combined API and web in a monorepo
4. `/static-frontend`: Ultra-simple static HTML approach

All of these should work once the underlying Railway account/project configuration issue is resolved.
