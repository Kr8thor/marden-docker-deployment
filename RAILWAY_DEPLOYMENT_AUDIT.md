# Railway Deployment Audit

## Summary of Deployment Issues

After multiple deployment attempts to Railway, we've identified a persistent error pattern with the following characteristics:

- Every deployment returns a 404 response with `X-Railway-Fallback: true` header
- This occurs across multiple service types (Docker, Node.js, static)
- This occurs across multiple deployment approaches (separate services, monorepo)

## Detailed Findings

### Attempted Approaches

1. **Original Backend/Frontend Dockerized Deployment**
   - Result: 404 errors with X-Railway-Fallback header
   - Status: Failed

2. **Simplified Test Applications**
   - Result: 404 errors with X-Railway-Fallback header
   - Status: Failed

3. **Direct Node.js Backend**
   - Result: 404 errors with X-Railway-Fallback header
   - Status: Failed

4. **Static Frontend**
   - Result: 404 errors with X-Railway-Fallback header
   - Status: Failed

5. **Monorepo Structure**
   - Result: 404 errors with X-Railway-Fallback header
   - Status: Failed

### Error Analysis

The consistent `X-Railway-Fallback: true` header indicates that requests are reaching Railway's edge network but not being routed to your actual services. This suggests:

1. **Project Configuration Issue**: The routing or domain settings for the project may be misconfigured.

2. **Service Visibility**: The services may be deployed but not properly exposed to the internet.

3. **Account/Billing Status**: There may be account-level limitations preventing proper deployment.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Create a New Project**
   ```bash
   railway projects create marden-seo-audit
   railway link --project marden-seo-audit
   cd railway-monorepo
   railway up
   ```

2. **Check Web Dashboard for:**
   - Service Status
   - Build Logs
   - Network Settings
   - Domain Configuration

3. **Contact Railway Support**
   - Share the consistent X-Railway-Fallback errors
   - Ask about project routing configuration

4. **Consider Alternative Platforms**
   - If Railway issues persist, consider alternatives like:
     - Render.com
     - DigitalOcean App Platform
     - Heroku
     - Netlify + Heroku

## Next Steps to Configure audit.mardenseo.com

Once deployment is successfully working:

1. Use the Railway CLI to add the custom domain:
   ```bash
   railway domain audit.mardenseo.com
   ```

2. Configure DNS Settings:
   - Add a CNAME record for `audit` pointing to your Railway domain
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 72 hours)

3. Verify SSL Certificate:
   - Railway will automatically provision an SSL certificate
   - Verify it's working by checking for HTTPS support
